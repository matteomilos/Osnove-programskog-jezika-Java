/**
 * In computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting
 * computer software to different languages, regional differences and technical
 * requirements of a target market (locale).[1] Internationalization is the
 * process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be
 * adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
 * Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a
 * specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and
 * translating text. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple
 * times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided
 * by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, or as an
 * integral part of ongoing development).
 * <p>
 * This class is a core of that.
